  <b>Hi there!</b>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
  My name is <b>IVIirror</b> and I am currently a Senior Data Analyst at an Energy company based in the United States. I have a background in data analysis, database management, and machine learning, and I am always seeking new opportunities to apply these skills to solve complex problems.

  I have a passion for using data to drive decision-making, particularly in the areas of safety analytics and sports analytics. I have experience working with a variety of tools, including Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. Some of the projects I have worked on include:
  <ul style="font-size: 16px;">
    <li>Converting a retail store's spreadsheet record system into a fully functioning PostgreSQL database</li>
    <li>Cleansing Covid-19 data from an international country into a modellable format</li>
    <li>Currently, I am building a classification model that predicts if the home team of a single NFL game will win or not</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, video gaming spending time with loved ones. I am excited to connect with other developers and data professionals in the Github community and to collaborate on meaningful projects. Thanks for stopping by!
